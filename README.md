1. Kustomise a fighter AI so it will kill things quickly (you tell me what's good, I'm just using Kano for now)
2. Open up the AHK macro.
3. Go into endless tower, select your character and make sure the AI is checked.
4. Press F3 to start the macro.
5. Go to school/work/afk, and come back to heaps of currencies.

side note: F4 will quit the macro.
